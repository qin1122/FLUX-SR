A vintage bicycle is mounted on a textured wall with peeling paint, featuring a mural of two children interacting with the bike. A young woman in a red top and black shorts playfully grips the rear of the bicycle frame, standing on the sidewalk in flip-flops, adding to the lively urban street art scene.
