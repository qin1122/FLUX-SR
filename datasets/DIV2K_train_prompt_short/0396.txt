A dramatic scene of molten lava flowing into the ocean, creating steam and smoke. The foreground features turbulent ocean waves, while the background is dominated by dark volcanic rock. Bright orange lava streams are visible at three points: left, center, and right, contrasting against the dark rocks and white steam. The sky above is overcast, adding to the moody atmosphere.
