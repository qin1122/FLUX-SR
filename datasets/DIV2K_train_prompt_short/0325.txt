A large stone bridge with multiple arches connects two urban areas. On the left, tall white residential buildings are surrounded by trees. To the right, densely packed older buildings with red roofs are visible. Below the bridge, a green-domed mosque and minaret are nestled among greenery. The sky is overcast.
