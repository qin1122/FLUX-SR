A small stone hut with a dark roof sits on the right side of the image, surrounded by snow. The foreground features rocky terrain and patches of grass on the left. In the background, layers of mountains stretch across the horizon under a bright blue sky with wispy clouds. The sun shines brightly near the top center, casting light across the scene.
