A pug dog is wrapped in a beige and plaid blanket, sitting on a forest trail. The blanket covers the dog's head and body, with the blanket's fringed edge visible on the ground. The background shows a green, leafy environment with soft lighting, and there are scattered leaves on the ground. The focus is on the dog in the center of the image.
