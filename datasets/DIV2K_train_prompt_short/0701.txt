A traditional Chinese pavilion with a black-tiled roof is on the left, partially obscured by leafy branches in the foreground. Red wooden frame windows adorn the building. In the center, a dragon relief decorates the pavilion's wall. To the right, a serene pond reflects surrounding greenery and distant traditional architecture under a bright blue sky.
