A vibrant red brick wall features a central yellow door with a frosted glass panel, flanked by two black lanterns. To the right of the door is a brass mailbox. A white bicycle with black accents leans against the wall, positioned below a tall, arched window with red shutters. A blue gas meter is visible at the bottom right corner.
