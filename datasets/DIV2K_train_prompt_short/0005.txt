A vertically split image features two distinct textures: on the left, an array of small, square green tiles creating a mosaic pattern; on the right, smooth white pebbles densely packed. The contrasting textures highlight the natural and crafted elements, separated by a subtle dividing line running vertically through the center. The image emphasizes the harmony between human-made and natural forms.
