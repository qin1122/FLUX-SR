A detailed view of an old engine's cylinder head, featuring a metallic surface with a blue gasket running across the perimeter. Eight shiny rocker arms are neatly aligned, centrally positioned, against a textured background. Oil marks and bolts are visible, along with white cloth stuffed on top of the engine. The atmosphere feels industrial and mechanical.
