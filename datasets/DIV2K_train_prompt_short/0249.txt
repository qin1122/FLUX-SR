A grassy field with three zebras. In the foreground, an adult zebra stands slightly left, facing right, with a foal close beside. The background features another zebra walking right, separated by a dirt path. Sparse bushes and rocks are scattered across the grass, creating a natural, open landscape under a clear sky.
