Two scuba divers are submerged underwater, both equipped with diving gear including masks, regulators, and tanks. They are engaging in a task at the seabed, using tools to work on a pipe encrusted with marine organisms located in the lower third of the image. Bubbles rise to the water's surface from their actions. The open ocean surrounds them.
