The image features an ornate stone archway, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris, with four golden horses atop. Pink marble columns support the structure. Below the arch, groups of people walk along a path, with a Ferris wheel visible in the background on the left. The scene is lit by soft sunlight, with trees lining the area.
