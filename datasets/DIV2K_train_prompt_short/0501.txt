Two women in traditional dresses stand by large windows. The left wears a white dress with red floral patterns, gold jewelry, and yellow-orange pom-poms. The right has blue floral designs, gold jewelry, and a red pom-pom. Both have lacy headdresses and hold their dresses to show embroidery. Tropical plants and a festive sphere are visible in the background.
