A wooden pier extends from the foreground to the midground, flanked by tall wooden posts on both sides. The pier leads over a partially frozen body of water, with ice visible on the surface. In the background, a series of docks and boats are visible, with a cloudy sky overhead. The scene is serene, with a cool color palette of blues and greys.
