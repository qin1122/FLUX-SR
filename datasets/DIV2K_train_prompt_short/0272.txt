A lighthouse stands on a rocky outcrop in the center-right, with its light beaming across the sea. A winding stone path leads from the foreground to the lighthouse, bordered by rugged rocks and waves. The sky is a deep blue, with scattered clouds on the horizon, and the sea stretches out to the distant land.
