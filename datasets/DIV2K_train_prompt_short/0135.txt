A white tiger with dark stripes reclines on a tree branch, its head near the left edge, mouth slightly open, ears perked. Vibrant green foliage surrounds, creating a natural canopy. The rough tree trunk contrasts with the tiger's sleek fur. Its front paw rests on the branch, back feet tucked beneath its body.
