A group of soldiers in camouflage uniforms and tactical gear are walking on a gravel path. They carry large backpacks with rolled mats on top. Two soldiers in the front hold a stretcher with a green cover. The soldiers have various pouches and equipment attached to their vests, and some have rifles slung over their shoulders. The background shows a concrete structure and a grassy area.
