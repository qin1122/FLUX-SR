Two men sit cross-legged on a vibrant mat. The left man in a pink shirt holds a musical instrument with gourds and a flute nearby. The right man in an orange shirt plays a snake charmer's flute. A wicker basket with a cobra is between them. Decorated flutes and a green book are on the mat. Stone pavement is in the background.
