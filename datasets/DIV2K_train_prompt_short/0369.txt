A pile of roasted coffee beans is scattered across the center of a light wooden surface. The beans vary slightly in size and color, with a few stray beans positioned around the main pile. The wooden texture adds warmth and contrast to the brown coffee beans, creating a rustic and inviting atmosphere.
