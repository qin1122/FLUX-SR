A blue and white fishing boat occupies the foreground, with two fishermen in orange and yellow gear working on deck. The boat is docked at a pier, surrounded by crates and buoys. In the background, several colorful boats are moored, with people visible on the pier. The water is calm, reflecting the boats and pier.
