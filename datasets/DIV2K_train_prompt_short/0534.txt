A majestic elephant draped in vibrant red and blue cloth with yellow trim walks on a cobblestone path. Its trunk is raised, and large feet are visible. Weathered stone fort walls with square openings line the left side, extending into the distance. The sky is bright blue with scattered clouds, creating a serene atmosphere. The path curves right towards more fort structures.
