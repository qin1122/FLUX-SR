A breathtaking coastal landscape with towering cliffs on either side; lush green pine trees adorn the rocky surfaces. In the center, a narrow turquoise inlet leads to the distant sea, where sailboats float peacefully. The dramatic cliffs frame the serene scene, creating a natural gateway to the horizon.
