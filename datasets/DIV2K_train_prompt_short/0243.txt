A stone aqueduct with multiple arches spans diagonally across the image, cutting through lush green trees that occupy the bottom left and right corners. A serene river flows beneath, reflecting the structure above, with clear blue water visible near the bottom center and flowing to the right middle ground. The sky is a pale blue, with hints of clouds stretching across the upper part.
