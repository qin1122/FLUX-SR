A large ornate statue of a deity stands on a lotus pedestal, adorned with gold detailing, holding a book and sword, with a shield. A swan with outstretched wings is part of the pedestal. In the foreground, three smaller statues of children are seated, reading a book. The background features lush green trees and a building's roof.
