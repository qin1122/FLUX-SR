The image depicts a dense cluster of light green coral polyps with rounded tips, scattered across a textured, reddish-brown rocky surface. The coral formations are irregularly shaped, resembling fingers or antlers, and are distributed throughout the image, creating a vibrant underwater scene. The background features darker patches, adding depth and contrast to the coral's pale hues.
