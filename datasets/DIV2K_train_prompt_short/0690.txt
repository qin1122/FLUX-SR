Scattered on a white marble surface with grey veins are evenly spaced chocolate chip cookies, each displaying a golden-brown hue, forming roughly five rows. The cookies are circular, some overlapping each other slightly, and showcase visible chocolate chips. The arrangement is regular, yet the cookies' unique shapes and textures offer a casual and rustic appeal.
