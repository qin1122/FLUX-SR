A sea lion sits on a sandy beach under bright sunlight, looking upward to the right side of the image. The sea lion's flippers are slightly forward, and the sand is light brown with some footprints. A small rock is nearby on the sand towards the bottom right corner. The background is clear sand extending into the distance.
