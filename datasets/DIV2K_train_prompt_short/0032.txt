A historic stone bridge with multiple arches extends across a calm, shallow river. In the background, a crenellated tower rises on the right, while several people walk across the bridge's top. Below the bridge, large buttress-like structures emerge from the water. The sky is overcast, and the scene includes rocky riverbanks scattered with stones and sparse grass.
