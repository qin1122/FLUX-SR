A coastal landscape with a rocky cliff on the left, covered in green trees and vegetation. A winding road runs along the cliffside, leading to small buildings nestled among the trees. The sea stretches across the right side, meeting the horizon under a clear sky with wispy clouds. Mountains are visible in the distance, creating a serene and picturesque view.
