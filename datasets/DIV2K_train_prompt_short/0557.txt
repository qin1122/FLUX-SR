A small village with simple houses, some tiled, others metal-roofed, sits before a rocky hill. Ancient ruins crown the hill, featuring a crumbled church with a tower. The late afternoon sun casts warm, golden light, creating long shadows on the rugged terrain. Sparse vegetation and distant hazy mountains complete the scene under a soft, cloudy sky.
