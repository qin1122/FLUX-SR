A medieval-style hood contrasts vividly with black and cream colors, draping over shoulders. The hood's apex reveals a strip of purple fabric above the forehead. A silver hoop earring dangles discreetly from the ear, partially visible beneath the hood. The background wood texture completes the rustic ambiance, heightening the ensemble's historical aura.
