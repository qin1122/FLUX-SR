A person in a navy blue jacket stands in a leafless forest, hands in pockets, back leaning against a tree trunk in the center of the image. The background is filled with densely packed, thin, brown tree trunks and branches creating a wintry scene with scattered leaves on the ground, giving a rustic and serene feel to the environment.
