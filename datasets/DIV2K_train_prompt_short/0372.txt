A winding mountain road stretches across the frame, bordered by rocky slopes and grassy patches. In the foreground, a person walks along the road. A large transmission tower stands mid-right, with a red cable car ascending. The road continues to twist alongside towering pines, while power lines run diagonally across, leading to distant hills under a clear, sunny sky.
