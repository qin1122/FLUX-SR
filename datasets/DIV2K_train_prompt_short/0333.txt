A serene waterfall cascades down the center of a lush, moss-covered gorge, surrounded by steep rocky cliffs. Below, a small boat with two people floats on the calm, turquoise water, positioned slightly to the right of the waterfall. The vibrant greenery and rugged textures create a tranquil, natural scene.
