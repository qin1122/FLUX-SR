A long, arched bridge spans diagonally across the image from the center to the right, with a river flowing beneath it. In the foreground, leafy branches hang from the top left corner, framing the scene. Buildings and mountains are visible in the background, with a hotel sign on the left side. The water flows smoothly, creating a serene atmosphere.
