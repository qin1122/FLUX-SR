In a zoo setting, a giraffe stands centrally, bending its neck to eat hay from a feeder. To the left, several zebras are gathered, grazing on the ground. In the background, another giraffe stands near a wooden structure. On the upper left, people observe from a raised platform. Tall trees line the background, adding greenery to the scene.
