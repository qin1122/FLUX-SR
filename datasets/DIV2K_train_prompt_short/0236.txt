A rugged desert landscape with a narrow ridge extending from the foreground to the left, where several people are walking. The ridge is flanked by steep, eroded formations leading to vast sand dunes in the background. The sky is overcast, with clouds covering most of the upper part of the image, casting a soft light over the scene.
