A bullfighter dressed in a traditional ornate red and gold costume stands in the arena holding a large red cape. The bull, positioned to the left, charges forward with its head down, kicking up dirt. The background features a red wooden barrier with white accents, enclosing the sandy arena. The bullfighter's cape flows dramatically, creating a dynamic scene of movement and tension.
