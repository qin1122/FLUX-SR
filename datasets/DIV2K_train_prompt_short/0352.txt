A large bronze horse sculpture with detailed bridle is in the foreground. Behind it, a bustling market scene includes shops like "Happy Herb Shop" and "The Creperie." A glass walkway leads to a modern building with a curved roof. People sit on benches along cobblestone steps, with a "Toilets Downstairs" sign visible.
