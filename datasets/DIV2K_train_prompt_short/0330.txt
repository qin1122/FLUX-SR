The image shows an aerial view of a hilly landscape with winding roads and wind turbines. The turbines are aligned along the lower section of the image, following a curved path. The winding roads branch and snake through the landscape, weaving around the hilly terrain. The green hills cover most of the image, with a few clusters of small buildings visible in the upper part.
