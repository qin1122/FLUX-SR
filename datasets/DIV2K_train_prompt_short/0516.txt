A grand library interior with a high arched wooden ceiling, lined with tall bookshelves filled with books on both sides. Busts of historical figures are evenly spaced along the shelves. A long display case runs down the center aisle, and green ropes guide the path. The perspective draws the eye towards the vanishing point at the far end.
