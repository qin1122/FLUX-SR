A sweeping view of a winding river bordered by tall, steep reddish-brown canyon walls fills the image. The river curves gracefully from the bottom center to the upper right, with a dam situated at the top right corner. A small boat is visible on the river, surrounded by lush vegetation. The canyon extends into the distance under a clear blue sky.
