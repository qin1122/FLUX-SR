A large glass pyramid dominates the center, illuminated from within, reflecting on the wet ground. The pyramid's structure is composed of numerous triangular glass panels. On either side, historic buildings frame the scene, adding a classical contrast to the modern pyramid. The night sky above is dark, enhancing the glow of the pyramid.
