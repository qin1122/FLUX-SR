A cluster of four red-capped mushrooms with white spots is positioned in the foreground, surrounded by green grass and fallen leaves. The background features a blurred, lush green foliage, creating a natural woodland setting. The mushrooms vary in size, with the largest one slightly off-center to the right, and the smallest to the left.
