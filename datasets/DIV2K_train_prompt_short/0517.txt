In the foreground, a large tugboat named "Union Coral" is docked. Its bow shows chipped paint and large rubber fenders. The midsection carries a rope extending to the dock on the left. The superstructure is white, topped with a red and yellow wheelhouse, and metal railings. In the background, concrete structures and blue sky complete the scene.
