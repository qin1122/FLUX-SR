A bustling market scene with cobblestone street, colorful dresses hanging on the right, vibrant fabrics and garments displayed on the left. People are walking and browsing stalls, some carrying bags. A child sits on the ground with toys laid out in front. Traditional architecture with intricate designs is visible in the background, and the street is wet, reflecting the lights from the shops.
