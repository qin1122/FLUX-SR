In a cramped room with white walls, three men in wheelchairs are assisted by individuals nearby. A man in a navy uniform stands in the center, wearing a backpack and gloves, while another uniformed person holds a colorful blanket. A man in a red shirt stands with folded arms next to a seated person, creating a tense atmosphere.
