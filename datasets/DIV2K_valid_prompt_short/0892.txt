The image shows a modern ceiling with a geometric lattice pattern of interlocking diamond shapes. The diamonds transition from purple to blue, creating a wave-like effect. The curvature is more pronounced on the left, adding depth. Light enhances the texture and color gradient, emphasizing symmetry and modern design.
