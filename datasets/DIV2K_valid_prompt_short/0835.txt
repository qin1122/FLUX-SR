A serene winter scene with a wooden bridge at the top, crossing over a rocky gorge. Below, a frozen waterfall cascades down the center, surrounded by snow-dusted rocks. The foreground features a clear, turquoise pool reflecting the icy landscape above. Sparse trees frame the scene, adding a touch of nature's resilience.
