A curled red fox occupies the center of the image, resting on snow. Its bushy tail wraps around its body, with one eye visible, peering towards the camera. The fox's ears are upright, contrasting against the soft, blurred background of blue and white hues. Sparse, dry grass is scattered around the fox, adding texture to the snowy foreground.
