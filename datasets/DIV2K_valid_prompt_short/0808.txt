A serene landscape with a small white boat floating in the foreground on calm blue water. Behind, a rocky shoreline leads to several wooden cabins, painted in shades of red and gray, nestled among green trees. A winding road ascends to a white house on the right, with a mountain rising majestically in the background under a clear blue sky.
