A rockhopper penguin stands on rugged, dark gray rocks, slightly off-center to the left. Its yellow crest contrasts with its black and white body. The penguin's wings are slightly spread, and its pink feet are visible. The rocky background is textured with shades of gray and black, creating a natural habitat setting.
