A large crocodile lies on sandy ground in the foreground, its mouth slightly open, facing right. Its textured scales are prominent. In the background, another crocodile partially submerged in green water, with only its head visible, facing left. The sandy area is scattered with small rocks and shadows, creating a natural habitat scene.
