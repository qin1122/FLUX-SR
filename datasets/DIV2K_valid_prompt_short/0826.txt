A vibrant traditional Chinese archway with intricate designs and three ornate roofs stands in the foreground, supported by four red pillars. Chinese characters adorn the central section. Behind, a grey-roofed building is visible, surrounded by bare trees under a clear blue sky. A person walks along the stone path through the archway.
